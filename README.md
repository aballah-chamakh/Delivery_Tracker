# Delivery_Tracker (note : this project still under dev)
the idea behind this project is to give delivery companies a full solution to help them automate the process of managing their drivers and orders 
by tracking them on real time 
<br/>
## the technologie used on this project : 
- Django <br/>
- DjangorestFramework <br/>
- Django Channels <br/>
- React js <br/>
## testing
because this app still under that's mean i have no drivers to track and in order to solve this problem in decide to write a simple python scritp that will send some fake location data about a paticular driver wich will allow me watching this driver moving on the map . <br/>
the repo for the python script : https://github.com/aballah-chamakh/DeliveryTrackerFakeDriver
